# customAutocadCivil3dCommands
This repository contains some autocad / Civil3d commands that can be useful for plan production
Commands:
1 - sectionlabelonbandset: Adds offset and elevation texts in section bands on point that you specify.
2 - Civil2Autocad: Converts civil3d objects(alignment, profileview, section views etc.) to plain autocad compatible objects and puts them into a block. 
3 - ALI2PRO: Draws an xline on profile view corresponding to the km that you specify on horizontal alignment.
4 - Point2Section: Draws an xline on section view corresponding to the distance that you specify on sample line center.
5 - ExportGeojson: export autocad objects to geojson and transform to specified coordinate system (not stable)

In "function.cs" there are a lot of methods that you can use them to build your own commands. Feedbacks are always welcome.
